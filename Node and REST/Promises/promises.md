consider a scenario where you and your roommate want to have dinner together. You want to prepare your special soup. 
At the same time you feel like having tacos from the food truck nearby. You ask your roommate. 'Hey can you go down to the food truck and get us some tacos?' 
When he is about to leave you will tell him, 
    'There is no point in me waiting till you're back to prepare the soup. So, I'll start with the soup now but when you reach the place can you promise that you'll text me so taht i'll start setting up the dinning table.'
    'Also let me know if something goes wrong. If you can't find the food truck or they are out of tacos for the night. Let me knwo that you cannot get  the tacos and i' will start cooking some pastas instead.' Your friend says, 'Sure I promise, I'll head out now and text you in some time.'
Now you go about preparing your soup but the status on tacos is currently pending till you receive any message from your friend.
When you get the text message saying that he is getting tacos, your desire to eat the tacos has been fulfilled. You can then proceed to setup the table.
If the text message says that he cannot bring the tacos, your desire to eat the tacos has been rejected an now you have to cook some pastas instead.
